    <h5 style="text-align: left; color: blueviolet;">Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, which are the seeds of berries from the Coffea plant.
    </br>The genus Coffea is native to tropical Africa (specifically having its origin in Ethiopia and Sudan) and Madagascar, the Comoros, Mauritius, and Réunion in the Indian Ocean.
    </br>The plant was exported from Africa to countries around the world.
    </br>Coffee plants are now cultivated in over 70 countries, primarily in the equatorial regions of the Americas, Southeast Asia, India, and Africa.
    </br>The two most commonly grown are arabica and robusta.
    </br>Once ripe, coffee berries are picked, processed, and dried.
    </br>Dried coffee seeds (referred to as beans) are roasted to varying degrees, depending on the desired flavor.
    </br>Roasted beans are ground and brewed with near-boiling water to produce coffee as a beverage</h5>
